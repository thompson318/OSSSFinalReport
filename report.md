## Summary: What was the project about
The project funded the ongoing development of the software sustainability dashboard for SciKit-Surgery. [SciKit-Surgery](https://github.com/SciKit-Surgery) brings together a set of libraries targeted to support research in image guided surgery. The SciKit-Surgery team needed a tool to enable the monitoring of how sustainable software best practice was being followed across the project. Such tools are available for individual packages, but these were not suitable for a project consisting of many discrete packages.

In 2021 we developed a prototype dashboard to take a snapshot of metrics across different libraries, but the dashboard had no automation to enable updating as the libraries changed. The Open Source Software Sustainability funding scheme has enabled the development of an automated dashboard using existing infrastructure (GitHub actions) to create a constantly up to date dashboard.
